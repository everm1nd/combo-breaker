# combo-breaker
Helps to find unclosed bracket in 1000-lines SASS/CSS/EcmaScript file

### Usage
This script takes lines from STDIN so you can use a pipeline:
```
cat style.css | ruby breaker.rb
```

### ToDo
 * ***Please, refactor this. It's so ugly.***
 * Add support of file like argument
 * Make it a gem?
